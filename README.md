## Instructions
* To run the project, first enter into the elixir interactive shell using: *iex -S mix*

* Then type: *Application1.start(:abc,numNodes, numRequests)*
  For example: *Application1.start(:abc,100,10)*

* The program will output the average number of hops taken in case of no failure and one in case of failure.

## What is working
We have implemented all the functionalities of the Chord network, as described in the paper, like routing, addition of node, deletion of node, stabilization, etc.   

## Largest network
We tested the program with 10000 nodes.
